# Erasing the Opportunity Gap in New York City Public Schools

## The "Why"
College is the single best indicator of higher lifetime income. College completion starts with a high-quality PreK-12 education and access to resources like quality healthcare and housing. Unfortunately, not everyone has access due to generational poverty or larger, systemic issues. This leads to gaps in college completion rates by race, with Whites completing college at higher rates than Black and Hispanic/Latino students. From local education agencies to postsecondary institutions, all decision-makers have a stake in student success. The future of our economy depends on higher rates of student achievement from cradle to college so all students succeed. 

The SHSAT (Specialized High School Test) provides students with access to a higher quality education, but clear barriers exist for historically underserved students. The goal of this project is to increase the diversity of students taking the SHSAT. By focusing efforts in under-performing areas that are historically underrepresented in SHSAT registration, a path to specialized high schools will become more available for economically and racially diverse students.

## About the Data 
Two datasets were pulled by PASSNYC from the New York Department of Education (NYDOE). The first is a database of thousands of schools across New York City and the second is SHSAT registration and testers. 

## End Product
An infographic was designed using Adobe Illustrator with visualizations created in R Studio.
